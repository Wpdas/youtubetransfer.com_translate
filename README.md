### Help me improve the service :D
Hello, I need help translating the files containing the interaction texts of the site. If you want to help me. Just choose one of the files already available and translate it into the language you want to see in the system.

The site now recognizes two languages automatically. They are the Brazilian Portuguese and English.

In the future, when new translation files are received, the site will have the language choice option.

### Current Texts
* [pt-br](./pt-br/pt-br.json)
* [en-us](./en-us/en-us.json)

### About Bugs and Tips
Feel free to report bugs or give your tip. Use "Issues Option" for this.

### More information
